**🚀 Healthcare Claims & EDI Translator AI**

🧠** Problem**

Healthcare systems rely on complex formats such as EDI 837, MMIS workflows, and policy-driven validation rules.

**This creates major challenges:**

Claim rejections are hard to understand
Providers struggle to fix billing errors
Analysts spend time decoding technical messages
Patients receive unclear explanations

> The core issue is translation of technical healthcare language into actionable understanding

**💡 Solution**

This project builds a persona-aware AI system that translates healthcare claim and EDI messages into clear, role-specific explanations.

**The system:**

Interprets claim rejection messages
Explains the issue in plain English
Suggests next steps
Adapts output based on user persona

Personas supported:
🧑‍⚕️ Patient
🏥 Provider (billing staff)
🧑‍💻 Analyst / Developer
⚙️ Tech Stack

LLM: Ollama (local models like Gemma / Qwen)
UI: Open WebUI
Document Parsing: Docling (PDF → Markdown)
Architecture: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Environment: Docker + macOS (M1)
Language: Python (for scripts & processing)

**🔒 Compliance & Ethics**

This project strictly follows responsible AI principles:

✅ Uses only public healthcare documentation (CMS, Medicaid, etc.)

✅ Uses synthetic examples for testing

❌ Does NOT use real patient data (PHI)

❌ Does NOT use internal Medicaid or employer data

👉 Designed to be safe, reproducible, and shareable

**📥 Sample Input**

Claim rejected: Member not eligible on date of service

**📤 Sample Outputs**
🧑‍⚕️ Patient

Your insurance coverage was not active on the date of your visit. Please contact your provider or insurance company to verify your eligibility.

**🏥 Provider**

Eligibility check failed. Verify the member ID and coverage dates before resubmitting the claim.

**🧑‍💻 Analyst**

Eligibility validation failed during claim processing. Check subscriber ID and coverage data in the eligibility system for alignment.
